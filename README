Create a new repository on github (free open source one)
Write the code in php using OO principals 
Use oauth2 to get an access token
Use the token to look for JPG files in the user account 
Download the files and organize them in directories structure by date (<year>/<month>/<day>/aaa.jpg) according to the photo's “date taken” (you can use a tool like “exiftool" to get the jpeg meta data – EXIF -  and extract date taken)
Extra points for a (highly) scalable solution
